        <h2>About the Role</h2>
        <p>You'll be involved in the technical and graphical aspects of pages and will determine the look of the website as well as how it works. You may also be responsible for the maintenance of an existing site. The term web developer is sometimes used interchangeably with web designer, but this is misguided.
